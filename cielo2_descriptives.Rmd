## Cielo 2 Descriptives

This Markdown doc includes Cielo 2 descriptive data. 

Ashley- think about what other things you'd like to visualize descriptively with the data that we have. What would be useful for us/the reader to see? What info do you need for the manuscript? 

```{r reading in data}
d_all <- read_csv("\\cielo2_cleaneddata_real.csv")

```

```{r god certainty plot}
godcertainty_plot <- ggplot(d_all, aes(sort_god_sure)) +
  geom_bar(fill='pink') +
  labs(x='Degrees of Certainty', y="Number of Participants", title ="Certainty of God's Realness") +
  theme_minimal()
godcertainty_plot
```




```{r sort data vis}

# here, we're creating a new dataframe for a subset of our data that we want to look at (the sort questions). when we create a new dataframe, we want to use the select function in the dplyr package loaded in our setupchunk. which columns do we want to select to include in this subset? probably all of the sort_ columns and pid, and gender? maybe age too. start there.
d_exist <- dplyr::select(d_all, gender, exist_germs, exist_tooth, exist_vitamins, exist_merm, exist_elf, exist_fairy,
                         exist_soul, exist_god, exist_santa, exist_elf, contains("id_num"))

#i'm subsetting out the other gender because they are only one participant in cielo1
d_exist<-subset(d_exist, gender!="Other")

# let's reshape our data to tall format so we can include all of the same plots on the same figure watch this youtube video for what it means to reshape our data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLCKL7BNIAk&ab_channel=StatisticsGlobe

# hl added the reshape2 library to our setup chunk. this is the library that the melt function is in (just fyi)
d_exist <- melt(d_all, id.vars= c("id_num", "gender"))

#let's view our tall data now. did we do it right?

# here, i'm making a dataframe with frequency counts added in (just to see what kind of figure i should end up with)
#only do this with a subset of your data, including the "sort" variables or "sort_sure", for example. my sort data was called exist in my code, so that's why you see d_exist here
