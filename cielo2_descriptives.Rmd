## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r reading in data}

d_all <- read_csv("\\cielo2_cleaneddata_real.csv")

```
```{r god certainty}
godcertainty_plot <- ggplot(d_all, aes(sort_god_sure)) +
  geom_bar(fill='pink') +
  labs(x='Degrees of Certainty', y="Number of Participants", title ="Certainty of God's Realness") +
  theme_minimal()
godcertainty_plot
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
